# README: Data Mining for Complaint Analysis

**Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing customer complaints using data mining techniques. The goal is to preprocess and analyze a dataset of customer complaints, identify relevant complaints based on user queries, and visualize the relationships between complaints using graph-based methods. The project uses Python libraries such as pandas, nltk, scikit-learn, and networkx for data processing, text analysis, and visualization.

-------------------
**Key Objectives**
- Preprocess Complaint Data: Clean and preprocess customer complaint text for analysis.
- Identify Relevant Complaints: Use text similarity techniques to find the most relevant complaints based on user queries.
- Visualize Complaint Relationships: Create a directed graph to visualize the relationships between relevant complaints.
  
---------------------
**Dataset**

The dataset used in this project is a collection of customer complaints with the following key columns:

**CASE_DESC**: The description of the customer complaint.

**OFFER_NAME**: The service or product associated with the complaint.

**CUSTOMER_TYPE**: The type of customer (e.g., CBU, EBU).

**COMPLAINT_TYPE**: The type of complaint (e.g., Technical, Commercial).

**PRODUCT**: The product associated with the complaint (e.g., Internet, Mobile).

--------------------------------------------

**Dataset Features:**

-CASE_DESC: The main text of the complaint.

-Other Columns: Metadata about the complaint, such as customer type, product, and complaint type.

--------------------------------------
**Methodology**

The project follows a structured approach to preprocess, analyze, and visualize customer complaints:

**1. Data Preprocessing**
- Text Cleaning: Remove punctuation, stopwords, and perform stemming on the complaint text.

- Language Handling: Handle Arabic text by normalizing characters and removing stopwords.

- Duplicate Removal: Remove duplicate complaints to ensure data quality.

**2. Text Similarity and Relevance**
- TF-IDF Vectorization: Convert the preprocessed text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.

- Cosine Similarity: Calculate the similarity between user queries and complaints to identify the most relevant complaints.

**3. Graph Visualization**
- Directed Graph: Create a directed graph to visualize the relationships between relevant complaints.

- NetworkX: Use the networkx library to generate and visualize the graph.
  
--------------------------------------------
**Results**
- Relevant Complaints: The system identifies the top 5 most relevant complaints based on the user's query.

- Graph Visualization: A directed graph is generated to show the relationships between the most relevant complaints.
-------------
**Future Enhancements**
Advanced Text Processing: Incorporate more advanced NLP techniques such as word embeddings (e.g., Word2Vec, GloVe).

Real-Time Query Handling: Implement a real-time system for handling user queries and providing instant results.

Interactive Visualization: Create interactive visualizations using libraries like plotly for better user experience.
